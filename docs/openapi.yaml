  description: |
    ## Overview
    The Decentraland Places API provides programmatic access to scenes, worlds, and user interactions within Decentraland.

    This API allows you to discover places in Genesis City and Decentraland Worlds, search for content, manage user favorites and ratings, and retrieve user activity data.

    Authentication: Some endpoints require authentication using Decentraland's authentication system with Bearer tokens:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-decentraland-auth-token>
    ```

    Endpoints requiring authentication are marked with a 🔒 icon.

    
    ### Response Format

    All responses follow a consistent structure:

    **Success Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "ok": true,
      "data": [...],
      "total": 100
    }
    ```

    **Error Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "Error message description"
    }
    ```

    ### Coordinates Format

    Parcel coordinates are represented as comma-separated integers: `"x,y"` (e.g., `"-23,-96"`).
    Valid range: `-150` to `150` for both x and y coordinates.

    Place ID Semantics

    Each place has a persistent UUID that follows specific rules across scene redeployments:

    **UUID Preservation Rules:**

    A new scene deployment will **keep the same UUID** if it meets one of these criteria:
    - The new scene parcels contain **every parcel** from the previous scene (allows growing)
    - The new scene has the **same base parcel** as the previous scene (allows reshaping/shrinking)

    A new deployment gets a **new UUID** when:
    - Moving to completely different parcels with a different base parcel
    - Shrinking without preserving the base parcel

    **Examples:**
    - ✅ Same UUID: Expanding from 1 to 4 parcels (contains all previous)
    - ✅ Same UUID: Reshaping the scene but keeping the same base parcel
    - ✅ Same UUID: Shrinking but maintaining the same base parcel
    - ❌ New UUID: Moving to entirely different parcels with different base
    - ❌ New UUID: Shrinking and changing the base parcel

    **Why This Matters:** This ensures user favorites, likes, and social data persist when scenes are updated,
    while creating new places when the scene fundamentally changes location.

        Retrieve a paginated list of places (scenes) in Genesis City with extensive filtering and sorting options.

        **Common Use Cases:**
        - Get most popular places: `?order_by=like_score&limit=20`
        - Search by name: `?search=casino`
        - Find places at coordinates: `?positions=-23,-96`
        - Get user's favorites: `?only_favorites=true` (requires auth)

        **Performance Tips:**
        - Use pagination (limit/offset) for large result sets
        - Cache results when possible
        - Use `with_realms_detail=true` only when you need real-time user counts

      security:
        - ServiceToken: []
      description: |
        Update the ranking score for a place. **Requires service token authentication.**

        This endpoint uses a pre-configured service token for authentication, intended for
        service-to-service calls from the data team's systems. The token must be provided
        in the Authorization header as `Bearer <token>` or just `<token>`.

        The ranking value is used to order places in listings. Higher ranking values appear first
        (after highlighted places). This endpoint is intended for the data team to curate
        place ordering based on quality metrics or promotional needs.

        **Use Cases:**
        - Promote high-quality places in listings
        - Adjust place ordering based on data analysis
        - Set custom ordering for promotional periods

        **Authentication:**
        Set the `DATA_TEAM_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable on the server, then use that
        token value in the Authorization header when calling this endpoint.

        **Authentication:** Optional. When authenticated, enables `only_favorites` filtering and populates
        `user_like`, `user_dislike`, and `user_favorite` fields in responses.
        
        **Key Features:**
        - Combines Genesis City places and Decentraland Worlds in a single response
        - **Highlighted destinations are always returned first**, followed by **ranking value** (descending), then by the specified order_by
        - Filter places by exact coordinates (pointer)
        - Filter worlds by exact name (world_names) or LIKE matching (names)
        - Filter by SDK version (includes places with null SDK)
        - Include connected user wallet addresses (with_connected_users)
        - Include live event status (with_live_events)

        Retrieve multiple specific destinations (places and/or worlds) by their UUIDs in a single request.
        Maximum 100 destination IDs per request.

        **Authentication:** Optional. When authenticated, enables `only_favorites` filtering and populates
        `user_like`, `user_dislike`, and `user_favorite` fields in responses.

        **Use Cases:**
        - Fetch details for a known set of destinations
        - Resolve destination IDs from external sources
        - Batch operations for better performance

        **Note:** Results are returned in the same order as requested IDs when available.
        All query parameters from the GET endpoint are supported for additional filtering.

        Retrieve both Genesis City places AND Decentraland Worlds in a single query.

        **Combined Data:** Merges places and worlds into one result set for comprehensive map display.

        **Use Case:** Applications that need to show all available content (places + worlds) on a single map interface.

        **Higher Limits:** Default limit of 2000 to accommodate both places and worlds.

        A place (scene) in Genesis City or a Decentraland World.

        **Place ID Persistence:** The UUID is preserved across scene redeployments when:
        - New deployment contains all previous parcels (growing)
        - New deployment keeps the same base parcel (reshaping/shrinking)

        The UUID changes when the scene moves to different parcels with a different base.
        This ensures favorites, likes, and social data persist through scene updates.
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
          description: |
            Persistent unique identifier for the place. This UUID is maintained across scene
            redeployments as long as the scene keeps the same base parcel or contains all
            previous parcels. See "Place ID Semantics" in the API description for details.

          description: |
            All parcel coordinates occupied by this place. Places can span multiple parcels.
            **UUID Preservation:** If a new deployment contains all these parcels plus additional ones,
            the Place UUID is preserved (scene growth). However, if parcels are removed or changed,
            the UUID may change unless the base_position remains the same.

            type: string

          description: |
            Primary/spawn coordinate for the place. This is the main parcel where users spawn
            when entering the scene. **Important:** The base parcel is key to Place ID persistence -
            keeping the same base parcel across deployments preserves the Place UUID and all
            associated user data (favorites, likes, etc.).
